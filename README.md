# dogecoin-paper-wallet

Generate a Dogecoin paper wallet offline, without the need for a browser.

## Usage

lein run

The program will print out a private key and a public bitcoin address, and a wallet.png file
that you can send to your printer (hopefully not connected to the internet). 
The paper wallet is unencrypted, so keep it in a safe place.

The wallet will look like this:

 ![wallet](https://raw.github.com/dbasch/dogecoin-paper-wallet/master/wallet.png)

 You may want to do this on a computer that's never been connected to the internet. For example, you could:

 * Boot a live CD/USB of Ubuntu, don't connect it to a network.
 * run `lein uberjar` on a trusted computer, copy the jar file to a pen drive and then to the Ubuntu box.
 * run `java -jar bitcoin-[version]-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar` on the Ubuntu box. 

## WARNING WARNING WARNING 

Be very careful when using this program. It uses the [dogecoinj](https://github.com/langerhans/dogecoinj-new) library for key generation
 so I'm not responsible for any bugs that might generate insecure wallets. Use at your own risk.
